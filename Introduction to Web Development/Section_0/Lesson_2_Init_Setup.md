# Initial Setup

## Cloning the Repository

To get started, we need to clone the ✨special✨ repository that contains all of the project files. To do this, we need to run the following command in our terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SAIS-Hack-Club/build-your-own-website.git
```

This will create a new folder called `build-your-own-website` in our current directory. We can change into this directory by running the following command:

```bash
cd build-your-own-website
```

## What's in the Repository?

Now that we've cloned the repository, let's take a look at what's inside. We can do this by running the following command:

```bash
tree
```

This will print out a tree-like structure of all of the files and folders in the repository. Here's what it looks like:

```bash
.
├── assets
│   └── images
│       ├── [ ... ]
│   └── styles
│       ├── [ ... ]
└── index.html
```

*P.S. If you don't have `tree` installed, you can see the contents of the repository by running the following command:*

```bash
ls -R
```

*You will get a slightly different output, but it will still give you an idea of what's in the repository.*

Let's take a look at each of these files and folders:

| File/Folder | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `assets` | This folder contains all of the images and stylesheets that we will use in our website. |
| `assets/images` | This folder contains all of the images that we will use in our website. |
| `assets/styles` | This folder contains all of the stylesheets that we will use in our website. |
| `index.html` | This is the HTML file that contains the content of our website. |
