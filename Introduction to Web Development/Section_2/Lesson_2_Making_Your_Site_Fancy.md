# Making your site fancy ðŸ’…

Now that you know the basics of HTML and CSS, let's make your site look a little nicer. We'll be using a framework called [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to make our site look nice and responsive. Bootstrap is a framework that makes it easy to create responsive websites. It's a very popular framework, and it's used by many large companies, including [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/), and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/).

## Adding Bootstrap to your site

To add Bootstrap to your site, we'll need to add a few lines of code to the `<head>` element of your `index.html` file. To do this, we can add the following lines of code:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.2.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha512-SbiR/eusphKoMVVXysTKG/7VseWii+Y3FdHrt0EpKgpToZeemhqHeZeLWLhJutz/2ut2Vw1uQEj2MbRF+TVBUA==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" />
```

This line of code will add the Bootstrap CSS to your site. Now, we need to add the Bootstrap JavaScript to our site. To do this, we can add the following lines of code:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.2.3/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha512-1/RvZTcCDEUjY/CypiMz+iqqtaoQfAITmNSJY17Myp4Ms5mdxPS5UV7iOfdZoxcGhzFbOm6sntTKJppjvuhg4g==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></script>
```

This line of code will add the Bootstrap JavaScript to your site. Now, your site should look a little nicer!

**Note: I am currently using Bootstrap 5.2.3. If you are using a different version of Bootstrap, you may need to consult the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) to find the correct links to add to your site.**

Now, it's time to go crazy with Bootstrap! ðŸ¤ª Let's add some Bootstrap components to our site. We'll start by adding a [navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/) to our site.
